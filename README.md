#### Project Notes

This repository includes some very basic practice with drawing shapes, etc.

The shared-canvas directory houses a websocket app for drawing with friends. This app
could be used as a shared whiteboard for drawing simple sketches or diagrams.

- Learned to configure nginx server to deploy multiple apps

----
#### Areas to Improve
- Improve mobile responsiveness
